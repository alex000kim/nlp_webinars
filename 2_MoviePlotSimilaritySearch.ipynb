    "- unlike `word2vec`, which uses a bag-of-words assumption, transformers take into account the sequence of words in the entire document\n",

    "In 1996, aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, Brock Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS Titanic. They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they only find a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the Titanic struck an iceberg.[Note 1] Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, and her granddaughter, are brought aboard Keldysh. Rose recounts her experiences aboard Titanic.\n",
    "In 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fiancé Cal Hockley, and Rose's widowed mother, Ruth, board the Titanic. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage to Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class Titanic ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to jump overboard. Jack appears and coaxes her back onto the deck. The two develop a tentative friendship, but when Cal and Ruth strongly object, Rose acquiesces and discourages Jack's attention. She soon realizes she prefers Jack over Cal.\n",
    "Rose brings Jack to her state room and pays him to sketch her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers and builder discussing the serious situation. Cal discovers Jack's sketch and Rose's insulting note left inside his safe, along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame him for theft. Jack is then confined in the master-at-arms' office. Cal puts the necklace into his overcoat pocket.\n",
    "With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they barely make it back to the boat deck. Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat. Having arranged to save himself, Cal falsely claims he can get Jack safely off the ship. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back on board. Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. They get away, and Cal realizes that he gave his coat, and consequently the necklace, to Rose; he later boards a lifeboat posing as a lost child's father.\n",
    "Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and the ship's stern is rising as the flooded bow sinks. As passengers fall to their deaths, Jack and Rose desperately cling to the stern rail. The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section dives downward. The remaining stern slams back onto the ocean, then upends again before it, too, sinks. In the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for one person. Some time later, Rose, barely alive, is saved by a returning lifeboat, but Jack, still clutching the panel, has died of hypothermia.\n",
    "The RMS Carpathia rescues the survivors; Rose avoids Cal by hiding among the steerage passengers and gives her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal's overcoat, she discovers the necklace tucked inside the pocket. In the present, Rose says she later heard that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean that has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep or has died in her bed,[8] her photos on the dresser depict a happy life of freedom and adventure.\n",
    "A young Rose reunites with Jack at Titanic's Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died on the ship.\n",

    "An elderly veteran walks through a cemetery, accompanied by his family. Coming across a specific grave, he is overcome with emotion and recalls his time as a soldier. On the morning of June 6, 1944, the U.S. Army lands at Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy invasion. Captain John H. Miller leads a breakout from the beach, overwhelming fierce German resistance. Meanwhile at the United States Department of War in Washington, D.C., it is learned that James Francis Ryan of the 101st Airborne Division is the last of four brothers presumed alive but missing. General George C. Marshall orders Ryan to be found and sent home.\n",
    "Miller soon receives orders to lead a unit to find Ryan. Arriving in the contested town of Neuville between the German defenders and the 101st Airborne, it is learned that Ryan is defending a key bridge in the fictional town of Ramelle. While assisting the 101st in Neuville, one of Miller's men is shot by a German sniper and is killed in action. En route to Ramelle, Miller decides against the judgment of his unit to neutralize a German machine gun nest, resulting in the loss of the unit's Medic. A surviving German soldier is spared by the intervention of Upham; Miller blindfolds the soldier and orders him to surrender himself to the next Allied patrol. When Reiben threatens to desert, Miller defuses the situation by revealing his civilian background as a teacher.\n",
    "Soon arriving in Ramelle, the remaining unit make contact with Ryan and inform him of his brothers' deaths. Though upset by the news, Ryan refuses to abandon his current posting, which soon comes under siege by attacking German armor. Miller and his unit fight alongside the 101st though the German armor advantage soon starts to take its toll on the Americans. In the ensuing battle, Jackson, Mellish and Horvath are killed. In an attempt to destroy the bridge with pre-placed explosives, Miller is fatally wounded by \"Steamboat Willie\", the German soldier he earlier spared. As the Germans approach the bridge, P-51 Mustangs as well as advancing American Shermans with infantry rout the Germans. Steamboat Willie is personally executed by Upham, who spares his comrades.\n",
    "As a result of his wounds, Miller dies, but first tells Ryan to \"earn this,\" referring to the postwar life that he will hopefully be able to experience. Ryan is revealed to be the elderly veteran from the beginning of the film and the grave belonging to Miller. Ryan expresses his gratitude for the sacrifices made by Miller and his men and states that he hopes he indeed earned it, before saluting Miller's gravestone.\n",

There's no clear definition of what's considered \"high-dimensional\", but generally, the cut-off point is somewhere around 50-100 dimensions.
